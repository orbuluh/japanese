## 2.2 この/その/あの/どの

- In Japanese, to specify "this [noun]," "that [noun]," or "that [noun] over there," you can combine **kono, sono,** or **ano** with a noun.
- These words are used to refer to both things and people, providing a clear way to express **proximity and identity.**

**この**

> **Usage:** Kono is used to indicate "this [noun]." It emphasizes something close to the speaker.

Examples:

- この本は面白いです。 (Kono hon wa omoshiroi desu.) - This book is interesting.
- この人は誰ですか？ (Kono hito wa dare desu ka?) - Who is this person?

**その**

> **Usage:** Sono is used to refer to "that [noun]," which is closer to the person you are addressing.

Examples:

- その車は高いです。 (Sono kuruma wa takai desu.) - That car is expensive.
- その店は美味しいですよ。 (Sono mise wa oishii desu yo.) - That restaurant is delicious, you know.

- あの建物は大学です。 (Ano tatemono wa daigaku desu.) - That building is a university.

**どの**
