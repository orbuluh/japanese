- `ALT - ~`: Cycles between kana and direct input mode

- `ALT - SHIFT`: Cycles through available languages

- `ALT - CAPS_LOCK`:  Switches to katakana input mode

- `CTRL - CAPS_LOCK`: Switches to hiragana input mode

- `SHIFT-ALT`:  Switches between English mode and Japanese mode.

- `Control - ~`: Switches between the current input mode and the English mode within the Japanese IME.

> TIP: Switching between Hiragana input mode and Direct Input mode through the language bar is tedious. Instead you can switch by pressing Alt-Tilde (the key below ESC on your keyboard).  So, if you need to type Japanese, press Alt-Tilde and start typing. When you are done press Alt-Tilde again to switch back to English. To achieve the same result when in Japanese mode, press Control - ~.
